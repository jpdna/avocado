Avocado User Guide
==================

Introduction
============

Avocado is a variant caller built on top of `Apache
Spark <https://spark.apache.org>`__ to allow rapid variant calling on
cluster/cloud computing environments. Avocado is built on
`ADAM's <https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam` APIs, and achieves variant
calling accuracy that is similar to state-of-the-art tools while being able
to drop variant calling latency to approximately 15 minutes when running on
a 1,024 core cluster.
